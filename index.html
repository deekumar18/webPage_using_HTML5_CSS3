                <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
                    J FRANK DOBIE SCHOOL was started in 2007 under the management of the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI) Fathers through
                    a registered body “Christ Educational Society of Bengaluru”. In the beginning it was associated with
                    Christ School (state board) and began to function as two separate Schools from May 2013. J FRANK DOBIE
                    SCHOOL is located a few blocks from the Bannerghatta road which runs through the southern part of the
                    city. Surrounded by convents and churches and an endless chain of little shops of Suddaguntapalya, the
                    School is ideally located and is least disturbed by the bustle of the city. Its atmosphere, the facilities,
                    the imposing granite buildings standing among scattered coconut palms, the large sports complex, the
                    skating-rink, the science labs, the computer lab, the well-equipped library and above all, it’s well
                    qualified and caring Teachers make the School one of its kind.

                <h2>DIRECTOR TALK</h2>
                <p> The world has changed enormously since J FRANK DOBIE SCHOOL welcomed its first students in 1935, but its
                    mission to attract and develop exceptional boys and teachers from all backgrounds to serve a meritocratic
                    India remains as vital now as it was then. With scholarships and bursaries available to support almost
                    half our students, we aim to reduce, as far as possible, any financial barriers to admission. At J FRANK
                    DOBIE SCHOOL we take our responsibility to find what is exceptional in boys very seriously. The experience
                    that we have prepared for them here gives every boy an all-round education built on a foundation of Service,
                    Adventure, Sports, Creative Arts and Academics. As a fully residential school we also nurture a commitment
                    to compassion, respect and well being that we believe is an antidote to the entitlement, anxiety and
                    lack of connection that dominate the day-to-day lives of so many teenagers.

                <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
                <p> Our mission is “To attract and develop exceptional boys and teachers from all backgrounds to serve a meritocratic
                    India; inspire them to be just and ethical citizens; train them to be wise and principled leaders; and
                    prepare them to enter one of the strongest alumni fraternities – for life.” Our vision is to take The
                    Doon School to its rightful position among the world’s pre-eminent educational institutions for boys
                    aged 12-18 years.

                    <h2>Boarding</h2>
                    <p> The Doon School is a full boarding school for boys only and not simply a school which welcomes boarders.
                        The school’s beautiful seventy acre campus with a vast range of flora, fauna and bird life provide
                        all boys with ample green space and fresh air where they are able to live and learn. It is an environment
                        rarely offered by schools in large and small cities in India, or indeed some other countries. All
                        boys are able to seek advice from the teaching staff, the Wellness Centre and the school counsellor
                        living on the school campus throughout the seven day week. Boys discover that they have much more
                        time to study and pursue their wider interests.There is no wasted time travelling to learn Sport,
                        Art, Music, Drama and benefit from Careers Guidance as well as other necessary university and college
                        entrance preparation.

                <div class="column">

                    <h2>Leadership</h2>
                    <p> The school culture encourages boys to innovate and take risks when developing new ideas and considering
                        solutions to problems. At Doon, leadership is taught within the school’s curriculum as well as through
                        a whole range of opportunities such as leading clubs and societies and sports teams. House life through
                        the prefect system, also provides leadership and collaborative experience. Leadership is also developed
                        through innovative and creative projects linked to the school’s social service programme to leading
                        and participating in the numerous academic and other committees that exist to discuss topics that
                        range from food to the library and games to technology.

                <div class="column">

                    <h2>Academic Ethos</h2>
                    <p> The Doon School’s academic ethos focuses on encouraging the boys to utilise their talents, and develop
                        their intellectual and creative interests so that they remain interesting and interested young men
                        for the rest of their professional and personal lives. The boys need to understand their own culture
                        and history, as well as their own geographical, scientific and spiritual theory and language. The
                        school’s academic environment is constructed such that the boys are able to develop their knowledge
                        and interest in these areas in an international context and around the global world in which they
                        are born and will live.
